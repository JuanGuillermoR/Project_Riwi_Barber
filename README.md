## Project Objectives
This project is for Module 3 and focuses on creating a barbershop website with various functionalities:
- Create a reservation
- Edit and delete a reservation within the system
- Wishlist feature
- Ensuring a seamless and pleasant user experience

## General Objective
The main objective of this project is to design and develop a website for scheduling appointments at a barbershop, aiming to enhance customer experience and optimize appointment management for the business. This website will provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows customers to conveniently and efficiently book appointments online, as well as access relevant information about the services offered by the barbershop.

## Problem Statement
Efficient appointment management plays a crucial role in customer satisfaction and the overall success of the barbershop. However, many barbershops still rely on traditional appointment booking methods, such as phone calls or in-person visits, which can result in an inconvenient experience for both customers and staff.
This traditional approach presents several challenges and limitations affecting the daily operation of the barbershop:
- **Inefficiency in appointment management:** Booking appointments via phone or in person can result in long wait times and potential scheduling errors, impacting operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
- **Lack of flexibility:** Customers may find it difficult to communicate during the barbershop's business hours to schedule appointments, limiting their ability to book services conveniently.
- **Potential loss of customers:** The absence of an online booking option can lead to losing customers who prefer the convenience of scheduling appointments through digital platforms.
- **Difficulty in maintaining accurate records:** Manual appointment management can lead to scheduling errors and make it challenging to accurately track availability and customer preferences.

## Project Scope
- **Target Audience:** This project is aimed at the administrative team of the barbershop, as well as the current and potential customers of the business.
- **Goals to Achieve:** Implement a digital solution to improve operational efficiency and customer experience at the barbershop. Specific objectives include:
  - **Meeting customer needs:** Provide customers with an easy and convenient platform to book appointments online, allowing them to schedule services quickly from any device with internet access.
  - **Optimizing appointment management:** Develop an efficient system that enables staff to manage schedules, track bookings, and reduce wait times for both customers and barbers.
  - **Increasing customer retention:** Enhance customer experience with automatic reminders, options for booking specific services, and the ability to choose a preferred barber to foster loyalty and retention.
  - **Improving operational efficiency:** Reduce the administrative burden associated with manual appointment management and minimize scheduling errors to improve business productivity.
  - **Differentiating in the market:** Position the barbershop as a modern and customer-centric place, offering a unique booking experience that stands out from the competition and attracts new customers.
